1. Modular Arithmetic with S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}
a) 4 + 4 mod 7 (there are 7 elements in the set)
The result is 1.

b) 3 × 5 mod 7
The result is 1.

c) The inverse of 3 mod 7

The additive inverse of 3 is 4
because 3 + 4 = 7 = 0 mod 7

The multiplicative inverse of 3 is 5 
because 3 x a = 1 mod 7, and a = 5

there is the `Extended Euclidean Algorithm` to find the multiplicative inverse of a number.

2. Is 'S' with the operation '+' a group?
To determine if this set with addition is a group, consider the group definition and check if the following properties hold:

*Closure*: Every addition operation within this set modulo 7 results in an answer also within the set
*Associativity*: Addition is associative, therefore (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
*Identity*: The identity element is 0, so when we add 0 to any number does not change the number
*Invertibility*: Every element has an additive inverse in the set (e.g. the additive inverse of 3 is 4, because 3 + 4 = 7 ≡ 0 mod 7).
Therefore S with the operation '+' can be considered a group.

*Note*: The set S with the operation '×' is not a group because the 0 element does not have a multiplicative inverse!!

3. -13 mod 5
−13=−7×2+1
the positive remainder is 1
The result is 1.

4. Polynomial x³ - x² + 4x - 12
Positive root
The positive root of the polynomial is approximately 2.

Degree of the polynomial


The degree of this polynomial is 3.

Note: No roots for polynomials of degree 5 or higher can be found using the quadratic formula. 
Degree 4 is also quite difficult to solve using the quadratic formula.
Numerical methods like the Newton-Raphson method are used to find the roots of polynomials of degree 4 or higher (proven by Abel and Galois).
